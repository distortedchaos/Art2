            <b><i>The Starry Night</i></b> (Dutch: De sterrennacht) is an
            oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter
            Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the
            east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,
            just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary
            village.[1][2][3] It has been in the permanent collection of the
            Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through
            the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Widely regarded as Van Gogh's magnum
            opus,[4][5] The Starry Night is one of the most recognizable
            paintings in Western art.[6][7]
          </p>
          <p>
            Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's
            ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the
            picture was painted from memory. The view has been identified as the
            one from his bedroom window, facing east,[1][2][17][18] a view which
            Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one
            times,[citation needed] including The Starry Night. "Through the
            iron-barred window", he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May
            1889, "I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in the
            morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory."[2][L 2] Van Gogh
            depicted the view at different times of the day and under various
            weather conditions, such as the sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled
            days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain. While the
            hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he
            was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper;
            eventually, he would base newer variations on previous versions. The
            pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal
            line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the
            Alpilles mountains. In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress
            trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field. Van
            Gogh exaggerated their size in six of these paintings, most notably
            in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing
            the trees closer to the picture plane.

          <b><i>The Scream</i></b> is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch
          in 1893. The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik (Shriek), and the
          German title under which it was first exhibited Der Schrei der Natur
          (The Scream of Nature). The agonized face in the painting has become
          one of the most iconic images of art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety
          of the human condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, had a
          formative influence on the Expressionist movement.[1]
        </p>
        <p>
          Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly
          the setting sun's light turned the clouds "a blood red". He sensed an
          "infinite scream passing through nature". Scholars have located the
          spot to a fjord overlooking Oslo[2] and have suggested other
          explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects
          of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his
          sister's commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum. Munch created two
          versions in paint and two in pastels, as well as a lithograph stone
          from which several prints survive. Both painted versions have been
          stolen, but since recovered. In 2012, one of the pastel versions
          commanded the at-the-time highest nominal price paid for an artwork at
          a public auction.

          In his diary in an entry headed "Nice 22 January 1892", Munch wrote:
          One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and
          the fjord below. I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over
          the fjord – the sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red. I
          sensed a scream passing through nature; it seemed to me that I heard
          the scream. I painted this picture, painted the clouds as actual
          blood. The color shrieked. This became The Scream.[3] He later
          described his inspiration for the image: I was walking along the road
          with two friends – the sun was setting – suddenly the sky turned blood
          red – I paused, feeling exhausted, and leaned on the fence – there was
          blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black fjord and the city – my
          friends walked on, and I stood there trembling with anxiety – and I
          sensed an infinite scream passing through nature.[3][4]

          Among theories advanced to account for the reddish sky in the
          background is the artist's memory of the effects of the powerful
          volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which deeply tinted sunset skies red in
          parts of the Western hemisphere for months during 1883 and 1884, about
          a decade before Munch painted The Scream.[5] This explanation has been
          disputed by scholars, who note that Munch was an expressive painter
          and was not primarily interested in literal renderings of what he had
          seen. Another explanation for the red skies is that they are due to
          the appearance of nacreous clouds which occur at the latitude of
          Norway and which look remarkably similar to the skies depicted in The
          Scream.[6][7] Alternatively, it has been suggested that the proximity
          of both a slaughterhouse and a lunatic asylum to the site depicted in
          the painting may have offered some inspiration.[8] The scene was
          identified as being the view from a road overlooking Oslo, by the
          Oslofjord and Hovedøya, from the hill of Ekeberg.[9] At the time of
          painting the work, Munch's manic depressive sister Laura Catherine was
          a patient at the mental asylum at the foot of Ekeberg.[10]
